# Express Boilerplate!

This is a boilerplate project used for starting new projects!

## Set up

Complete the following steps to start a new project (NEW-PROJECT-NAME):

1. Clone this repository to your local machine `git clone BOILERPLATE-URL NEW-PROJECTS-NAME`
2. `cd` into the cloned repository
3. Make a fresh start of the git history for this project with `rm -rf .git && git init`
4. Install the node dependencies `npm install`
5. Move the example Environment file to `.env` that will be ignored by git and read by the express server `mv example.env .env`
6. Edit the contents of the `package.json` to use NEW-PROJECT-NAME instead of `"name": "vendor-scrapper",`
7. If you want to use the debug module, uncomment the debug code lines
8. You can add console.log to the error handling middleware like so: else {
        console.error(error)
        response = { message: error.message, error }
    },  but remember to remove before deploying.
9. Update the connect scripts to the correct database and user

## Scripts

Start the application `npm start`

Start nodemon for the application `npm run dev`

Run the tests `npm test`

## Prepare for deployment

1. Reduce console logging to minimum
2. Confirm node version with `node --version`, and update engines in package.json
3. Run `npm audit`

## Deploying

When your new project is ready for deployment, add a new Heroku application with `heroku create`. This will make a new git remote called "heroku" and you can then `npm run deploy` which will push to this remote's master branch.
